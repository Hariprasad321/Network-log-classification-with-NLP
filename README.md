The network log is used to detect intrusion and spot malicious activity in the network. Manually checking the log entry and identifying the suspicious pattern is very tedious and not possible for big data set, the problem grows as the network logs are scaled up to large volumes of data. also note that we cannot employ conventional ML methods as these logs are entirely text data (unclassified data)


  This model uses NLP to classify the raw text files network logs as malicious or not and filters the suspicous acctivity for further actions.
